# easy-object (eo)

Small library which goal is to make object operations in JavaScript easy and faultless. Currently in development. You can check the newest version at develop branch.

Now working (I hope):

* checking if sth is an object,
* checking if sth is of a given type,
* shallow cloning,
* deep cloning arrays and objects.

### And will be more
